[Arab Spatial 2.0][arab] now houses over 200 indicators at the national, subnational, and pixel level over time. Indicators that may be used for policy and planning purposes to map regional patterns and trends.

The new features include: 

1. A gallery of downloadable pre-made graphs on Arab nationsâ€™ development and food security;

2. customized analytical tools that allow users to compare and explore data by indicators, regions, and year, and to download the results;

3. multilayer maps that dynamically track development projects geographically; and, 

4. a simpler navigation and greater interactivity for an enhanced user experience. 

Arab Spatial is becoming a platform that includes not just a regional focus, but also different country spatials starting with one for Iraq: Iraq Spatial that is currently under construction.
