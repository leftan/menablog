NEW! Iraq Spatial: Visit us at: [www.arabspatial.org/iraq][iraq]

Iraq Spatial, recently launched, aggregates a full range of development data and is the first resource of its kind.

Related to the more expansive [Arab Spatial][arab] (developed by IFPRI, the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) and the CGIAR Research Program on Policies, Institutions, and Markets (PIM)), Iraq Spatial provides more specific national and sub-national level data to assist in the precise targeting of interventions.

Providing over 200 data indicators, Iraq Spatial enables users to target policies where they are most needed, and map the estimated impacts of their interventions at precise locations.

Developed through USAID-funded Harmonized Support for Agriculture Development (HSAD), Iraq Spatial is a collaborative effort between IFPRI, International Center for Agricultural Research in Dry Areas (ICARDA), PIM, IFAD, Ministry of Agriculture of Iraq, and Ministry of Agriculture and Water Resources of Kurdistan.
